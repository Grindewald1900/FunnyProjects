### 1 - Facial Expression Recognition with Keras

#### Introduction
- The data consists of 48x48 pixel `grayscale images` of faces.   

- The objective is to `classify` each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).  

- Build and train a `convolutional neural network (CNN)` in `Keras` to recognize facial expressions.   

- Use `OpenCV` to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them.   

- Use `Flask app` to directly serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
